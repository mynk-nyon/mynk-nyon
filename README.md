🛠️ As a CIS Support Engineer, I assist in developing, deploying, and managing scalable and secure cloud infrastructure solutions using Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. I work with virtual networks, storage, compute resources, and automate infrastructure with Terraform. I contribute to implementing best practices for cloud security, cost optimization, and system availability.

🎯 Having participated in several CTF challenges, bug hunting programs, and internships, I continuously enhance my skills in security and cloud technologies. My goal is to protect sensitive information, ensure data integrity, and deliver exceptional web experiences.
